# I am static-php üëã

static-php ([crazywhalecc/static-php-cli](https://github.com/crazywhalecc/static-php-cli)) can build standalone PHP binary on Linux, macOS, FreeBSD, with PHP project together, with popular extensions included.

### üì¶ Standalone distributable binary

Manually compile PHP? Building a PHP environment using Docker? Installing PHP using package management? No longer needed!

Compile the PHP cli using [static-php-cli](https://github.com/crazywhalecc/static-php-cli) and distribute the PHP interpreter as part of the project!

### üêò Make Single-File PHP Executable

Powered by phpmicro, it is now possible to combine a PHP-cli project with the PHP interpreter into a single file and execute it!
